Hello, geeks! 👋

Learning, Unlearning, and Relearning. I am Abhishek Kumar. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology focused on Information
Technology. I am a self-motivated person and a fast learner along with that I have strong interpersonal skills. I see 
the world as a network of connected systems. I study these systems and their relationships to build what I need, from 
what I know. I look for opportunities that interest me and keep me motivated. I am an experienced developer skilled 
in C++, Java, MERN, Javascript, and its frameworks. ⚡ I am involved in a lot of organizational work in college related 
to clubs, fests, and workshops and helped in building many communities from scratch.

⚡ One line that describes me best?
An ambitious boy who loves to listen to music, daydream at night, and sometimes code too.😉😉
